##Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project: Soil Inspector Personal Assistant Agent
Prepared for: [Client Name]
Prepared by: [Your Name / Company]
Date: [Insert Date]

# 1. Overview

A personal assistant agent to support soil inspectors working on mine sites. The solution will improve efficiency, accuracy, and compliance by providing task automation, data capture, and reporting features that work in both online and offline environments.

# 2. Objectives

Reduce time spent on manual note-taking and reporting.

Ensure compliance with mine site safety and environmental regulations.

Provide inspectors with an AI-powered assistant for quick access to procedures, reminders, and knowledge.

Enable seamless data capture, storage, and reporting from the field.

# 3. User Personas
Soil Inspector

Needs to record soil conditions, tests, and samples quickly.

Works in remote areas with low connectivity.

Requires hands-free or minimal device interaction.

Site Supervisor

Needs summarized reports from inspectors.

Requires visibility of compliance and anomalies.

Management / Regulators

Require formal reports and compliance documentation.

Need access to historical inspection data.

# 4. Core Features
4.1 Task & Workflow Management

Daily schedule overview (inspections, tests, deadlines).

Reminders for safety and compliance checks.

4.2 Data Capture

GPS auto-tagging of soil samples.

Voice-to-text notes.

Photo capture with sample ID metadata.

Structured input forms (soil moisture, density, contamination indicators).

4.3 Knowledge Assistant

Conversational interface for “what do I need to do at this site?”

Access to mining regulations and soil classification standards.

Step-by-step guides for sampling/testing procedures.

4.4 Reporting

Auto-generate daily/weekly reports.

Export to PDF/Word/Excel.

Store results in Dataverse/SharePoint for long-term access.

4.5 Integrations

Power Automate workflows for notifications and report routing.

Power BI for dashboards/insights.

SharePoint/Dataverse/ERP integration (if required).

# 5. AI Features

Conversational agent for Q&A and instructions.

Speech-to-text for hands-free operation.

Anomaly detection (flagging unusual soil readings).

Smart reminders based on context (e.g., “Don’t forget to record moisture for this sample”).

# 6. Non-Functional Requirements

Offline Mode: Data must be captured offline and synced later.

Performance: Forms should load within 3 seconds; AI responses within 5 seconds.

Security: Entra ID authentication, encrypted storage, role-based access.

Compliance: Align with mining safety & environmental reporting standards.

# 7. Technical Architecture

Frontend: Mobile-first app (Power Apps Canvas App, or custom mobile app).

Backend: M365 Graph, SharePoint

AI Layer: Azure OpenAI + Cognitive Services (speech, vision).

Integration: Power Automate connectors

# 8. Success Metrics

30% reduction in manual report preparation time.

50% faster soil inspection data entry.

90%+ accuracy in captured inspection data.

Positive feedback from inspectors on usability.

# 9. Milestones & Deliverables

Phase 1 (MVP): Task scheduling, data capture (forms, photos, GPS), offline support.

Phase 2: Reporting automation, SharePoint/Dataverse integration.

Phase 3: AI assistant features (voice, anomaly detection, knowledge retrieval).

Phase 4: Scaling across multiple inspectors/sites, Power BI dashboards.

# 10. Risks & Assumptions

Risk: Poor connectivity on mine sites → requires strong offline mode.

Risk: AI recommendations must be reviewed before compliance submission.

Assumption: Client already has Microsoft 365 licenses.

Assumption: Inspectors use mobile devices (iOS/Android) provided by company.

# 11. Open Questions

Does the client prefer a Power Platform solution or a fully custom app?

What existing systems must it integrate with?

Are there government/regulator reporting templates that must be followed?

Will inspectors use gloves/helmets that limit device handling (affecting UX)?
